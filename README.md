<a id='Project Motivation'></a>
# Project Motivation:
In this project, we will make use of Python to exploring data related to bike-share systems for three major bike-share systems in the United States. We will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. We will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.




<a id='File Descriptions'></a>
# File Descriptions:
we have one notebook file that includes all the work related to the previous questions, and the dataset is available in [github](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/README.md)
